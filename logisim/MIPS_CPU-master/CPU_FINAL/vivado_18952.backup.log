ERROR: [Labtools 27-3175] Target jsn-Nexys4DDR-210292747757A is no longer available.
Please use disconnect_hw_server to close the current server connection. Check cable connectivity and that the target board is powered up.
Restart the hw_server application running on host localhost, port 3121 and then use connect_hw_server to re-establish connection to target.
